A variety of scripts to help perform common tasks with Gaussian from the command-line.

== spinwork.sh ==

This script takes an initial .gau input file (charge, mult, and coords) and generates and runs the necessary gaussian com files for a full workup of a spin system. This script relies on "skeleton" gaussian com files. The defaults are spinwork-[charge]-[state].com.skel in the current directory, or if not found the ones in SKEL_DIR.

For example, say 6-31+G** is too high a basis set: copy '/home/guest/scripts/spinwork-*.com.skel' (or just the specific step you want to change) and change those files with your editor of choice. The script will check the current working directory first before defaulting to the ones in $SKEL_DIR

Note: the logic for multiplicity is a little weird. The current way is to add or subtract from the starting multiplicty. Assuming the only source of multiplicity is from unpaired electrons (s=1/2) and multiplcity = 2s+1, adding or removing electrons will increment or decrement the multiplicity. By taking the difference in charge state between the current and initial systems, adding that to multiplcity yields the new high-spin multiplcity.

For the low spin calculations, the script assumes the last process ripped out a "spin important electron" and decrements the multiplicity. Because we are still using difference in charge (which gives +1 mult), we need to add a "-2" to the equation.

For now, this just runs the calculations, it'd be nice to have another utility that automatically does the workup, but that's for another time. Also. only does cationic systems, doing anionic systems shouldn't be too hard, but not a priority.
